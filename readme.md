## 🔖 Compatibility

- Xilinx: Developed and Tested on Zybo Z7-10 with Zynq 7010.
- Lattice: Synthesizes and uploads, but functionality untested.
- Altera: Almost synthesizes. Case inside SystemVerilog construct of `rtl/vga_timer.sv` is unsupported by Quartus, and it will not synthesize without modification.
